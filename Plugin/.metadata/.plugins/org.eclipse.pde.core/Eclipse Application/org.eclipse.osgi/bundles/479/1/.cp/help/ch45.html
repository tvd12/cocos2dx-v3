		<h3>Sharing Online</h3>
<p>You can upload your storyboards directly to WireframeSketcher servers (<a href="https://wiresketch.com">wiresketch.com</a>) and share them online. To share a screen or a storyboard use the <strong>Share Online</strong> action. This action can be invoked from the <a href="ch10.html">Toolbar</a>, <a href="ch11.html">Context Menu</a> or just by pressing <strong>Ctrl+Shift+O</strong> <a href="ch40.html">shortcut</a>. After the export finishes the link to your storyboard will open automatically in the browser. It&#8217;s a secure, unique, hard-to-guess link. Copy it from the browser&#8217;s address bar and the share it with your team or with your clients.</p>
<p>You can share online both screens and storyboards, however it&#8217;s only with <a href="ch34.html">storyboards</a> that you can share a clickable prototype.</p>
<p>You can also choose to share storyboards on your own servers. For this select the <strong>Save as <span class="caps">HTML</span> to a local folder</strong> option. Once finished you can upload exported <span class="caps">HTML</span> to your own servers. Another option is to use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. You can place <span class="caps">HTML</span> files directly in your Public folder and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/20">share them online</a> via a public link.</p>
<p>Sharing online offers the fastest way to test your prototypes on mobile devices such as Android and iOS.</p>
